# wclone project
*Thank you* for downloading wclone! I've put a few notes here for if you want to use the program much.

**NOTES**:

Use `wclone --autoconf` to make wclone automatically configurate itself to your system. This means that, if you've ran this command, you will be able to run wclone from anywhere you want.

Use `wclone --clearconf` before installing a new version of wclone. This is to clear every settings made by wclone to your system. It allows the new version to run without any errors.

Use `wclone --refreshconf` to clear- and autoconf your wclone in one command. I added this just to make it easier and faster for you.

Use `wclone --wclone` to view the information about the current wclone build. This can be used to check if there are any new versions of wclone. It also displays the errorcode at that moment.

Use `wclone --help` to see all the commands and arguments that you can use in wclone. It also displays the correct order for the arguments to be run.

Use `wclone --about` to view information about wclone. Information as in what wclone actually is.

Use `wclone --credits` to view the credits of all the creators of wclone.
